This is a quick demo project I put together to try out Swift on iOS. It's a
simple ToDo app using Core Data and NSFetchedResultsController.

Concepts covered in this demo project:

1. Using UIKit / Foundation in Swift
2. Using Core Data in Swift / subclassing NSManagedObject
3. Adding custom gestures to UITableView
4. Dealing with live re-ordering of table view cells
5. Adding closures to UIKit classes to avoid delegate methods 
6. Working with iOS 7 / 8 iPhone 6 / 6+
